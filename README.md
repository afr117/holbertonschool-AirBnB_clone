# AirBnB clone - The console

This is the first step in building an AirBnB clone.

This first step is a command interpreter that can be run in interactive and non-interactive mode.  It is written in Python and are the foundational modules that will be then linked to the solution's front end and back end and will be able to manage the objects of our project:

- Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
- Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
- Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
- Update attributes of an object
- Destroy an object
- a high-level overview of the project, including the language in which it's written, what it does, why it's useful;

### First step tasks that need to be written: 
### Write a command interpreter to manage your AirBnB objects.
- put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances
- create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
- create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Place…) that inherit from BaseModel
- create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
- create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine
